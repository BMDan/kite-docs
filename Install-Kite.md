title: Install Kite
---

To download Kite with `curl`, run the following commands from a terminal window:

```
curl http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/kitesdk/kite-tools/0.16.0/kite-tools-0.16.0-binary.jar -o dataset
chmod +x dataset
```

The first command downloads the Kite tools JAR to a local file named _dataset_. The second changes the access rights on the JAR so that the classes in the JAR are executable.
