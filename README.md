# Kite SDK Guide

Kite is a set of libraries, tools, examples, and documentation focused on
making it easier to build applications on top of the Hadoop ecosystem.

This repository contains the Kite SDK Guide.

## Building

If you haven't already done so, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your system.

Then, you can build the current version of the documentation by executing:

```
jekyll build
```

This will compile the documentation into HTML in a directory called \_site.

## Debugging

You can view a live version of the documentation by executing:

```
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

and then viewing the site at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
